# Exploring the Pagila Database: A SQL Query Journey

This repository serves as a personal project to explore and master SQL queries using the well-known Pagila sample database. The Pagila database is a robust and comprehensive open-source database designed for learning and practicing PostgreSQL.
üöÄ Project Overview

My goal with this repository is to document my journey from a SQL beginner to an advanced user. I'll be starting with the basics and progressively moving on to more complex queries.

The queries are organized into folders based on their complexity:

    basics/: Covering fundamental commands like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT.

    intermediate/: Diving into more advanced topics such as JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries.

    advanced/: Tackling complex queries, window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and more.

# Pagila Database Schema

A copy of the Pagila database ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) is included in this repository to help visualize the table relationships.
Understanding the schema is key to writing effective queries. Feel free to use this diagram as a reference while exploring the queries.
