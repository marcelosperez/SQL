# Exploring Databases: A SQL Query Journey

#  Project Overview

This repository documents my journey from a SQL beginner to an advanced user, with a focus on two major database systems: Oracle and PostgreSQL.

The goal of this project is to progressively move from basic to more complex queries, showcasing my learning process and problem-solving approach.

    **Oracle Queries**: These queries are developed and tested using the online Oracle Live SQL platform (livesql.oracle.com). The Oracle Queries folder contains the SQL script files and the corresponding CSV files with a subset of the query results.

    **PostgreSQL Queries**: These queries are primarily run on the well-known Pagila sample database. The PostgreSQL Queries folder contains the SQL script files and the corresponding CSV files with a subset of the query results.

This repository serves as a personal log of my progress and a resource for anyone interested in learning SQL across different database environments.


# Pagila Database Schema

A copy of the Pagila database ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) is included in this repository to help visualize the table relationships.
Understanding the schema is key to writing effective queries. Feel free to use this diagram as a reference while exploring the queries.
