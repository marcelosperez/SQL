-- List all departments that have at least one employee.
-- This exercise uses the EXISTS operator to check if a subquery returns any rows. 
-- The outer query selects the department name from the departments table, 
-- and the subquery checks if there is at least one employee in the 
-- employees table with a matching department_id
